清理文件时候发现wallpaper engine经常会出现订阅已经取消但是文件因为意外没删除的情况。Windows10现在不能直接显示文件夹大小且wallpaper engine删除文件不删文件夹，导致目录下存在大量的空文件夹进一步加大清理难度，于是用ai写了个这个。直接在资源管理器复制需要检查的路径粘贴进去即可。
When cleaning files, I found that Wallpaper Engine often has the situation that the subscription has been cancelled but the files are not deleted due to accident. Windows 10 cannot directly display the folder size now, and Wallpaper Engine deletes files without deleting folders, resulting in a large number of empty folders in the directory, which further increases the difficulty of cleaning. So I wrote this using AI. Just copy the path you need to check in the resource manager and paste it in.
